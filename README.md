This Python project implements a Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption tool using the Tkinter library for the GUI and the PIL library for image handling.

Key features:

Encryption & Decryption: Users can enter text and shift values to encrypt or decrypt messages based on the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
User-Friendly Interface: The GUI allows easy input of messages and shift values, with buttons for encryption, decryption, and clearing the input fields.
Background Image: A custom background image enhances the visual appearance, using PIL to load and resize the image to fit the window.
This project offers a simple yet practical approach to learning encryption concepts and GUI development in Python.
